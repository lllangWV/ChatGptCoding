# Coding with ChatGPT Webinar

Welcome to the repository for the "CodingWithChatGPT"! This repository serves as a companion to our live webinar event, where we explore the capabilities of AI in coding with a focus on the ChatGPT model from OpenAI.

## What is ChatGPT?

ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art language processing AI developed by OpenAI. It's based on the GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) architecture, which allows it to generate human-like text by predicting subsequent words in a sequence. ChatGPT has been trained on a diverse dataset, enabling it to assist with a wide range of tasks, including natural language understanding, text generation, and even coding.

## The Role of AI in Coding

Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing the field of software development. AI can automate repetitive tasks, suggest code improvements, identify bugs, and even write code snippets. The integration of AI into coding practices can significantly enhance developer productivity and code quality.

## Examples in this Repository

In this repository, you'll find Jupyter notebooks and code samples that demonstrate how ChatGPT can assist with different coding tasks. Here are a few highlights:

- **Example 1**: Using ChatGPT to explain complex code or algorithms in simple terms.
- **Example 2**: Using ChatGPT to generate code based on a given specification. (A Drunken Walk and A Double Pendulum)
- **Example 3**: Using ChatGPT to scrape a webpage for information and the analysis of that data. (Web Scaping and data analysis)
- **Example 4**: Using ChatGPT to optimize, document, and translate code to another language


Each example in the repository is documented with comments and explanations to illustrate how you can integrate ChatGPT into your coding workflow.

Feel free to explore the code, try out the examples, and see how ChatGPT can assist you in your development projects!
