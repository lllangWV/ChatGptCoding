    "\n",
    "Debugging is an essential aspect of the coding process. It involves identifying and fixing errors or \"bugs\" in your code to ensure it runs as expected. ChatGPT can be a valuable asset in debugging by providing insights, suggestions, and even potential solutions to issues within your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using ChatGPT for debugging, consider the following tips for prompting effectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Be Specific**: Clearly describe the problem you're facing. Include error messages, unexpected behavior descriptions, and the part of the code that seems to be the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Provide Context**: Share relevant pieces of your code with ChatGPT. It helps to provide surrounding code that could be influencing the bug.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ask for Clarification**: If you don't understand a part of your code or the error it's causing, ask ChatGPT to clarify. Understanding is key to fixing bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Iterative Process**: Sometimes, the first solution might not solve the problem, or it might lead to another issue. Be prepared to have a back-and-forth discussion with ChatGPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Code Snippets**: If you're stuck with a particular exception or error, ask ChatGPT to explain it and provide code snippets that illustrate how to handle such errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Testing and Verification**: After receiving suggestions from ChatGPT, make sure to test the provided solutions and verify that the issue is resolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Learning from Mistakes**: Use the opportunity to ask ChatGPT why the error occurred and how it can be avoided in the future. Understanding your mistakes is a great learning opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these tips, you can effectively use ChatGPT to assist with debugging tasks, leading to a more efficient and educational coding experience.\n"

    "The provided code defines a function named `fibonacci` that calculates the \\( n \\)-th number in the Fibonacci sequence using recursion. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. That is, the sequence goes 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `def fibonacci(n):` - This line starts the definition of the function called `fibonacci` that takes one argument, `n`, which is the position in the Fibonacci sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `if n <= 1:` - The function checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. The first two numbers of the Fibonacci sequence by definition are 0 (for \\( n = 0 \\)) and 1 (for \\( n = 1 \\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `return n` - If `n` is 0 or 1, the function returns `n` itself, since those are the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `else:` - If `n` is greater than 1, the function proceeds to the `else` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `return(fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2))` - This is the recursive part of the function. The function calls itself twice: once with the argument `n-1` and once with `n-2`, then adds the results of these two calls together. This corresponds to the definition of the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if `n` is 2, the function will return `fibonacci(1) + fibonacci(0)`, which is 1 + 0 = 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `n` is 3, the function will return `fibonacci(2) + fibonacci(1)`, and since `fibonacci(2)` will calculate to 1 (as we saw above), and `fibonacci(1)` is 1 by the base case, the result will be 1 + 1 = 2, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that this implementation, while simple and a direct translation of the mathematical definition, is not efficient for large values of `n` because it recalculates the same Fibonacci numbers many times. For larger values of `n`, an iterative approach or memoization (caching the results of previous calculations) would be more efficient.\n",
